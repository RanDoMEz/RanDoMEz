<span class="skills"> I hope that this year didn't disappoint, but I really have been overwhelmed with the various events throughout May to September and have not had time to plan a proper celebration or something as “logistically intensive” as last year. I hope that that was a kind reminder of the experiences that we have shared- and a possible precursor to the many years of being on the receiving end of MedLaw stereotypes as we (may) eventually become too busy for each other. But time is made, not set aside, and I will make time for you. 


Get ready for more surprises in the days to come, 
thank you for being patient with me, as always.
